    - Had to change 

        connectionString: getDatabaseUri()
                    TO
        connectionString: `postgresql:///${getDatabaseUri()}`

• I wasn't able to find an API point for getting jobs by company handle?



• The provided /companies GET route has a mistake within the optional query params.
    -The docstrings within companies.js specify 'nameLike' as the query param for filtering by name
